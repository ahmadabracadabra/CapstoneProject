# SADAS - Student Productivity Dashboard

## About the Project 
Our goal was to create a website primarily aimed at college students that consolidates the many tools students typically use across multiple apps into a single, easy-to-use platform. As the project progressed, we recognized that this platform could serve a wider audience beyond students, so we expanded our scope accordingly.

Many people rely on services like Canvas, Zoom, GroupMe, and various social media platforms daily. Our mission was to simplify users’ routines by offering one unified space to manage academic tasks, social connections, and finances—all in one place.

The core vision was to build a digital environment that empowers users, especially students, to stay organized, focused, and connected by having all the tools they need integrated seamlessly within a single platform.

## Collaboration

All team members worked together on developing a complete website, combining frontend and backend efforts to ensure seamless integration and functionality. Additionally, each member was responsible for designing and implementing their own full-stack feature within the website. My individual contribution focused on the Messaging system.

* **HTML** – Markup language for structuring web content.
* **CSS** – Styles the HTML content.
* **JavaScript** – Scripting language for interactivity on the frontend.
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework.
* **Bootstrap** – Front-end component library for responsive design.

### Backend & Database

* **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
* **Express** – Web framework for Node.js to handle routes and middleware.
* **bcrypt** – Library used for hashing passwords to enhance server-side security.
* **JWT (JSON Web Token)** – Used for secure token-based authentication.
* **CORS** – Middleware to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend-backend communication across domains/ports.
* **MySQL Workbench** – Tool for database design and management.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the backend server configured to run locally.

4. **Start the frontend:**

   * Use **Live Server** (or your preferred method) to serve the frontend files.
   * Open the frontend in your browser via Live Server.

5. **Access the application:**

   * Once both backend and frontend are running, navigate to the frontend URL.
   * The frontend will communicate with the backend API to provide full functionality.

### Additional Notes

* Ensure **MySQL** is running locally, and the database is set up according to the project schema.
* Update any environment variables or configuration files as needed, such as:
  * Database credentials (host, user, password, database name)
  * JWT secret keys
* Confirm that **CORS** middleware is enabled in the backend to allow communication between frontend and backend running on different ports/domains.
